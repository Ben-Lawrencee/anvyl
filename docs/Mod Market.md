Need to host some sort of market which mods can be downloaded from.

This would require strict security, through checksums / hashes, author signatures, accounts.

Also some DDOS protection, like rate limiting, authorization.
This only applies to publishing to the market, as downloading modifiers should not require authorization and therefore is anonymous.
